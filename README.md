Spamclassifier 

Sorry for the length, but its a project I did that I'm proud of. I feel like it shows skill with data structures and handling real data. I made this for a class I took in college, but its still good coding and something I built that has some real world application. Some parts were provided for the assignment but more than 90% is original code written by me.

Uses released Enron emails and some clever statistical math to calculate probability of a message being spam or ham (good email) based on occurrences of engrams, and then compares that to a specified threshold. I included the JUnit tests I wrote for it to show that I have some knowledge and proficency in testing. I haven't included the emails, simply to save space and time but I do have them still.

I hope you like what you see and will give me a chance.
